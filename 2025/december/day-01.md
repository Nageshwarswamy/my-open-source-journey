## Challenges Faced
1.Understanding how to use Git and GitHub.
2.Learning the meaning of common terms like "Repository" and "Fork."

## What I Learnt
-Today, I used Gemini AI to help me understand the basic tools on my GitHub dashboard. Here are the key points I learned:

**1. What is a Repository?**
-A **repository (or "repo")** is like a folder that stores all the files for a project.
-Every repo usually has a README.md file.
-The .md extension stands for Markdown.
-The README.md acts as the "front page" of the project, explaining what the repository is about.

**2. What is a Fork?**
-Think of a **"Fork"** as a personal copy of someone else's project.
-If you see a repository you want to improve or fix, you cannot change the original directly.
-You first "Fork" it to bring a copy into your own account.
-Once you make changes in your copy, you can suggest those changes to the original owners (I will learn the details of this process soon!).

**3. What is the Watch Button?**
-The **"Watch"** button controls the notifications you receive about a project.
**----- There are four main options------:**
i.Participating and @mentions: You only get notified if someone mentions your name or if you are involved in a conversation.
ii.All Activity: You get a notification for everything (commits, comments, and bug reports). This is great for small projects but can be overwhelming for large ones.
iii.Ignore: You get no notifications at all. I recommend avoiding this if you want to learn how open source works!
iv.Custom: This allows you to choose exactly which events notify you.
